        <p>I often think about activities we can engage in as one of two types: activities in which we're directing our attention and activities where our attention is being sucked in.</p>

<p>Some examples of activities where we control our attention:
* You are drawing a picture of a house, and you are thinking about what part to draw next.
* You are going for a walk, and you pick a path to go down.
* You are writing down your thoughts for the day in a journal.</p>

<p>Some examples of activities where our attention is controlled:
* You are reading a book, and the story pulls you in.
* You are playing a video game.
* You are watching a TV show.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more nuanced view thinks more about going in and out of flow states. And some states of commandeered attention can be good or bad. But it becomes less about always being in control of your attention (we waver and can get sucked into so many thiings!) but it's more about strategically picking the right things to get sucked into.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to Attractor Theory again.</p>

<p>But what I care about here is less about trying to find the most accurate model of things. Rather, there's something about the "staying in control of your attention" Mood or Aesthetic that I find rather interesting. </p>

        <p>Sometimes, it feels nice to just avoid being <strong>sucked in</strong>.</p>
