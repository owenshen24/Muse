        <p>I have a Mood or a Feel that I care a lot about. It's a little like minimalism. It's a little like praising deprivation. It's a little like mindfulness. I think that there is a lot to be mindful of in the space of doing things like being hungry / sore / lustful. In general, these are states where you have a feel of Wanting.</p>

<p>I think peering into this space of things is interesting, although I realize I haven't quite articulated why. Some other actions which also seem to fit this pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoiding video games / TV shows / general attention-commandeering activities</li>
<li>Taking more appreciation in very mundane activities like staring at a wall, going for a walk, or lying on the ground.</li>
<li>Eating bland foods.</li>
</ul>

<p>One explanation that sort of fits this Aesthetic is that I'm trying to find ways to renormalize my standards when it comes to rewards and reinforcement. In this way, if I'm finding even bland things exciting, then it's a lot easier to do productive things because most things in life tend to be better than bland things.</p>

<p>It doesn't feel like that from the inside, though. It just feels like a Good thing to do.</p>

        <p>I often think about activities we can engage in as one of two types: activities in which we're directing our attention and activities where our attention is being sucked in.</p>

<p>Some examples of activities where we control our attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are drawing a picture of a house, and you are thinking about what part to draw next.</li>
<li>You are going for a walk, and you pick a path to go down.</li>
<li>You are writing down your thoughts for the day in a journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of activities where our attention is controlled:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are reading a book, and the story pulls you in.</li>
<li>You are playing a video game.</li>
<li>You are watching a TV show.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, something like that. The key here is to pay attention to if you're doing a "getting sucked in" activity or a "mindfully plotting your way" activity. It's not exactly the best distinction, though. If you think about it, most of the time, we're quite entranced. Mindful deliberation doesn't seem to come into play more than, say, 20% of the time. The other 80% seems to more largely consist of a state of perhaps diminished awareness, save for the task at hand. Maybe the default is that we're always in a semi-state of flow, or some other mode where our attention is being sucked in.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more nuanced view thinks more about going in and out of flow states. And some states of commandeered attention can be good or bad, depending on our values. But it becomes less about always being in control of your attention (we waver and can get sucked into so many things!) but it's more about strategically picking the right things to get sucked into. You accept the fact that being mindful all of the time is costly and unsustainable, so instead you strive</p>

<p>Which brings us back to <a href="https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/mindlevelup-the-book/attractor-theory/">Attractor Theory</a> again.</p>

<p>But what I care about here is less about trying to find the most accurate model of things. Rather, there's something about the "staying in control of your attention" Mood or Aesthetic that I find rather interesting. </p>

        <p>Sometimes, when I'm on Facebook, I'll get a notification. I'll click on it, and then someone has sent me a message. I'll respond to the message, and then I've got a new notification. This cycle repeats itself. (Usually it's not this direct; maybe I go and respond to an email, then a text message shows up, and <em>then</em> I get a new notification.) The point here is that there's some chain of reinforcement which catches me in a loop, repeating the same activities over and over.</p>

<p>Inside, though, it just feels like "Ooh, there's this cool thing I can check out! Oh wow, now there's this <em>other</em> new cool thing I can check out!"</p>

<p>It's not the same thing, but I'm thinking about switching between tasks and the novelty they provide (more productive tasks, that is). Presumably there's some optimal pattern of choosing activities such that you can also reduce any feeling of fatigue.</p>

<p>But also, activities where you command your attention also tend to be more demanding. You might finish them and feel more tired. I don't know. Doing even normal attention-sucking things like watching TV or playing games also saturates really easily for me.</p>

<p>Maybe my general tolerance for doing the same thing is just lower than average.</p>
